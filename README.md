# Tower-Defense-Game

This is a tower defense game developed by my group for CS 2340 Objects and Design. It was developed in Java/ JavaFX, used a 2-week sprint Agile workplan, and used GitHub for collaboration and version control. Each student was responsible for writting implementation code, JUnit tests, and collaborate on documentation.


The code folder contains files used to build the game divided into view files for the screens, model files for entities, and a controller to run them together. In addition, the code folder contains JUnit test files to test the implementation of each sprint. The document folder contains a sequence diagram depicting a user's average experience with combat within the game.
